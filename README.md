#  Infinite Horizontal Scroll Through a Variable List of Items

This illustrates how to achieve infinite scroll on iOS using UIScrollView. The contents in the UIScrollView wrap around when you go past the end or scroll to the left past the first item. If there aren't enough items to fill the contents of the scroll view, they are simply repeated.

Look through ColorBrowser.swift for "MAGIC:" to see where all the magic happens.

In the demo app, you can use a slider to adjust the number of items (they're just some colors) and the width of each cell.
